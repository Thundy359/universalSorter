# universalSorter
Can use bubble sort on any data type. (numbers, strings, linked lists etc..)

Sorter.ts implements the logic.

Each data type you want to sort just needs a class that has a length property, compare method (A > B), and a swap method (swap A & B).

Pass in the values you want to sort as arguments during instantiation in index.ts and check the console!
